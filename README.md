# Fullstack app (react as frontend and asp.net core as backend)

- This app have login and register pages\
- User get a token whenever they log in\
- This token is used for authenticate (allow user to access some route and pages)\
- Im still working on problems with restricted routes using the token. so login right now just gives user a token that will be saved in their browsers.

## Backend webapi

### Go to webapi folder then run commands:\

- dotnet run

## Frontend react

### Go to react folder then run following commands:\

- npm install (to install all dependencies packages)\
- npm start (to run react app)
